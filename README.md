# Furniture E-Commerce (December Project)

A responsive furniture e-commerce landing page built using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Integrated **JWT token authentication** for secure login and protected sessions.  
Designed with a modern, performance-optimized UI powered by Tailwind.  
December project roadmap focused on landing experience, auth flows, and scalability.  
Extendable to full e-commerce features like product catalog, cart, and checkout.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
